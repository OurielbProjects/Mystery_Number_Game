# Mystery Number Game
### Overview

This Python script is an interactive game called "Mystery Number Game." The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's objective is to guess the mystery number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides hints about the relationship between the player's guess and the mystery number, such as "smaller" or "greater." The player wins if they correctly guess the mystery number before running out of attempts. The use of colored console output adds a visual element to the gaming experience. The code utilizes a while loop to allow the player to make multiple attempts until they either guess correctly or exhaust their chances.

### Technologies Used
